External data types are host language types that have been defined in the OCI header
files. When an OCI application binds input variables, one of the bind parameters is an
indication of the external data type code (or SQLT code) of the variable. Similarly, when
output variables are specified in a define call, the external representation of the
retrieved data must be specified.
